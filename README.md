# Status  
Working: All mutations work as expected, wether obtaining the mutagen works or not is still unclear.
# Mole-Mutations
  A mod for cataclysm which adds a mole mutation category, working as of 0.E-7938  
 
## Overview  
 This mutation is centered on poor sight and the ability to burrow, similar to the rat category but with less combat power and lower maintenance.

## Mutations  
Aside from sharing some mutations with the rat category, this has a few new mutations:
- Polydactyl: Restricts hand gear but adds a minimal crafting skill bonus.
- Loner: Serious debuffs to social abilities, intimidation isn't affected as much.
- Effective Breathing: Reduces mouth encumbrance, which grants a slight stamina recovery boost and helps offset mouth encumbrance.
- Tunneler Build: Reduces DEX by 1 but increases STR by 1.
  
## Recipes  
This only adds a mutagen and a serum that target the mole category, it is learned in the same way as the Beast mutagen/serum, it has the same costs as the Mouse mutagen/serum.
